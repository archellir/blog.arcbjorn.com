[Leetcode 389 problem.](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.
A function to return the letter that was added to `t`.

## Go

- Time complexity: $O(n^{2})$ - **n** is a length of a second string (`t`)
- Auxiliary space: $O(1)$ - constant amount of space

```go
import "strings"

func findTheDifference(s string, t string) byte {
    for idx, rune := range t {
        letter := string(rune)
        frequencyInT := strings.Count(t, letter)
        frequencyInS := strings.Count(s, letter)

        if (frequencyInT > frequencyInS) {
            return t[idx]
        }
    }

    return 0
}
```
